# MerryDining
HackIllinois 2021

MerryDining is an app that allows you to make reservations at restaurants/bars matching your dietary restrictions. With a reservation made on MerryDining, you can be seated near people with similar tastes/preferences. It also lets you connect with foodies who go to the same/similar restaurants who have similar food preferences as you.

There are two interfaces we developed for it:

## Customer Side
Users can sign up and choose their dietary preferences, explore restaurants and fellow MerryDiners nearby, and make reservations according to their dietary preferences! They can also pair up with others with similar dietary preferences who are dining alone.

## Restaurant Side
Restaurant managers can view the reserved and free seats. Our algorithm automatically clusters people of similar dietary preferences together. For example, vegan people will be found mostly sitting around each other, people allergic to shellfish will be kept away from tables with such orders/nearby other allergic people to ease the food serving process.
